### Introduction:   
   
I decided to design and 3D print business cards because I already have a 3D printer, and traditional business cards are expensive.
After looking around for some inspiration I found several existing projects in SCAD. Having never used SCAD before I decided to quickly learn how, obviously by learning it on the fly, from an uncommented, undocumented project.
For those of you who are lucky enough to have never used SCAD, allow me to explain, in simple terms, what it is. Imagine a programmer that wanted to do some CAD, but instead of just using a normal parametric modelling software they decided to create a 100% code based CAD program.

#### Here is what that looks like:
{% include image-gallery.html images="Code.png" %}

Despite the learning curve it has some really nice features. My favorite is the ability to allow the user to customize your designs by setting min/max values, selectble options, and editable fields:

{% include image-gallery.html images="Code_2.png" %}


### STL File
{% include image-gallery.html images="Card_2.png" %}  
### Default Card
{% include image-gallery.html images="Card_3.jpg" %}  

If you want to print some yourself you can go to [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1101836-parametric-business-cards-customizable#profileId-1097200)

  
### Thoughts:
I learned a lot while working on this project, and had a ton of fun! It brought together programming and CAD in a functional and exciting way.
