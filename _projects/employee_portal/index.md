# The journey to an Employee Portal

## In the beginning ...

I was initially told to create an inventory system using Cold Fusion, which I did, to about 95% completion. Then I was instructed to migrate and translate from Cold Fusion to Django while rebuilding it as a modular piece of an Employee Portal. I was assigned to the migration while my coworkers built the core of the modular system. Over the next two years, I helped design and implement three additional modules for the portal. The core contains the user management system and all the essential site functions.

## Training Module
This is the training module that facilitates ongoing employee learning and training. 

The admins can create and edit courses for employees.

Add various question types.
{% include image-gallery.html images="10.png" width="500" %}
and review the courses.
{% include image-gallery.html images="11.png" width="500" %}
Courses can then be assigned to users or user groups.
{% include image-gallery.html images="12.png" width="500" %}
Employees will be notified of pending courses.

Videos or documents can be embedded for each course

## Inventory System
The inventory system provides proper asset management for the company, including automated audits and tax reports.

## Form Flow

Form flow is a general purpose online form system, with one of the intended uses being purchase reimbursement requests

{% include image-gallery.html images="20.png" width="500" %}

The requests can be converted to PDF for record keeping and backups

{% include image-gallery.html images="21.png" width="500" %}

The admin will be notified whenever there is a pending request

{% include image-gallery.html images="22.png" width="500" %}

{% include image-gallery.html images="23.png" width="500" %}

Requests can be filtered and searched

{% include image-gallery.html images="25.png" width="500" %}

Data management is also included

{% include image-gallery.html images="28.png" width="500" %}

The user can check the status of their requests

## AI Chat

The final module is an AI chatbot with sanitized inputs. This prevents the users from sending sensitive information to OpenAI or other companies.
It filters out any sensitive information and replaces it with placeholders. This includes names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, API keys, credit, debit, and bank account numbers.

The admin dashboard also allows for easy cost and usage tracking.

Messages can be flagged for manual review

## Thoughts

I really learned a lot during this project, between the migration and the rest of the modules. I had a lot of fun working on something new every day!
