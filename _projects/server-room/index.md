### Thoughts:
I learned a lot while working on this project, between the structural, electrical, and thermal challenges, I felt that it really helped me grow.
It's also very fufilling to be able to look at something physical that you helped make.
Also it helped that prior to this I had to work right next to the servers, in the summer heat the room would go up to 85 degrees!
Now it sits at a comfortable 75 all year round.
